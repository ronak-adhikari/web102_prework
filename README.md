## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Understanding the different and newer JS fundtions was a little challenging at first. It took a few tries to properly build each function and verify its functionality and accuracy. Putting some of the keys together also seemed to be a little difficult because of the sensitivity of it.
